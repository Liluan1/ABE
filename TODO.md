Dmitri here are the main things left to do:

1) remove third-party (I don't think we need it?)

2) rework CMake to that we use the  installed palsade library. 
use the CMakeLists.User.txt approach. I had to hardwire the library in the cmake files because I did not understand the User.txt file was there. 

update the Readme.md file .
